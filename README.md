# Model Ensembling for Statistical Learning.
A bunch of primitive R and Python scripts for different small statistically black-box (unknown to data scientist/researcher - X/y) datasets. These were challenges under the Statistical Learning and Data Mining course taught at the University of Cassino. Results can be seen on my [website](https://yusuftengriverdi.github.io).
